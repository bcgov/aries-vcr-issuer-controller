# Generate passwd file based on current uid
# This is used in OpenShift to create an entry in the /etc/passwd file
# for the randomly assigned user context of the container.
#
# In order for this to work your Docker file must grant write access to the /etc/passwd file
# to the root group using `chmod g+rw /etc/passwd`
#
# This is required by Flask, actually `werkzeug`, when it it calls getpwuid();
#   File "/data-pipeline/.venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/werkzeug/debug/__init__.py", line 148, in get_pin_and_cookie_name
#     username = getpass.getuser()
#   File "/usr/lib/python3.6/getpass.py", line 169, in getuser
#     return pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid())[0]
#   KeyError: 'getpwuid(): uid not found: 1002170000'
#
# This is a known issue with Python on OpenShift; https://bugs.python.org/issue10496
